# Multi Account Terragrunt Infrastructure Setup

This repository is a personal setup of my infrastructure using Terragrunt. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides features such as keeping your remote state configuration and terraform code DRY. 

For more information on Terragrunt, check out the [official documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/).
